##  Oura Extract, Transform, and Dashboard

### Description
This project provides a framework for utilizing the [Oura Ring V2 API](https://cloud.ouraring.com/v2/docs) to extract 
personal Oura ring of interest, transform the data and create charts, and load the charts into a 
[streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) dashboard. I utilize the dashboard to create PDFs for printing out and 
bringing to doctor appointments. Streamlit is better for creating webapp dashboards than PDF reports. This project 
provided me with an opportunity to play around with streamlit and test its capabilities.

My previous iteration of this [project](https://github.com/MattyMyers22/Oura_Ring_R_md_PDF) relied on downloading CSVs 
of data from[Oura](https://cloud.ouraring.com/user/sign-in?next=%2F) and utilizing R for data manipulation, 
visualization, and loading the charts into an R Markdown file.
